This is the project repository for the elevator project in [TTK4145](https://github.com/TTK4145).

First initiate a Simulator by writing "./SimElevatorServer --port PORTNR"
Then start main by writing "go run main.go PORTNR"



The following modules were not authored by us, but were in some cases altered to better fit our application:
